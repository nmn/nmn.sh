After much procrastination, I finally decided to build a new website.
It's built using Next.js and MDX. And StyleX, _of course_!

```jsx
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

I already have [a blog](https://naman34.svbtle.com)
and I will keep it around for now. However, I've long
felt limited by Markdown alone and I wanted to be able to build the
occasional custom component to demo some code or a concept. Hopefully,
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) will let me do that. As such, all my future
writing will be on this website.

I also see this website as a playground to experiment with new technologies,
and use StyleX in a real-world project. This should help identify pain points
and make StyleX better.

A long time ago, I started my career more as a designer than a developer.
I'm also going to try my wacky design ideas on this website.

Finally, I will try to write more often, write about various side-projects
I'm working on, and have a reference of things I learn along the way. I also
want to have a dedicated place to write short notes and thoughts which don't
neccessarily make sense as a full blog post, but might still be valuable to
someone other than me.
