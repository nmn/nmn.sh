React has always been built on concepts from functional programming. It is almost a cliché to mention:

```jsx
UI = Fn(STATE);
```

However, the functional programming connections run a lot deeper, and over time React has only become _more_
functional. Initially, React components were stateful classes, and even though the `render` method was
pure, it would be a stretch to call the component itself a pure function. This was a long a difficult thing to
reconcile. Component often _need_ to be stateful. How do you represent them as pure functions? There have been
solutions to this problem in the functional programming world. The one that gets a lot of attention is **_Monads_**,
but not in a good way. Monads are widely misunderstood, can be confusing and often make the developer experience
more indirect than what feels natural. React, instead, adopted the idea of _Algebraic Effects_, and implemented them
in JavaScript in the form of "Hooks". Dan Abramov has a great article [explaining this in detail](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/),
but the important thing to note is that Hooks let you store state _without_ your component itself becoming stateful.
The state lives in the React runtime, and the component function can be "pure".

### Referential Transparency

So, what does this have to do with React Server Components? You see, one of the qualities of "pure" functions is that
they are _referentially transparent_. This means that you can replace a function call with its return value.

```jsx
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const result = add(2, 3);

// is the same as:
const result = 5;
```

This may seem obvious for a simple function like `add`, but it is a powerful property. It means that any long
computation can be "pre-computed" ahead of time and the result can be used in its place.

### Referential Transparency in React components

If you consider the root component that renders an entire app, it is not usually useful to replace it with the output
of the component. This is because, ususally, the _input_ to the component, i.e. the state of the app, is constantly changing.
(When this is not the case, we are already able to use static site generations to "pre-compute" the output of the app).

However, if you consider a smaller component, say a button, it is often obvious that many components can be _inlined_,
where they are used.

Consider a `ButtonPair` component.

```jsx
const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
);

const ButtonGroup = () => (
  <div>
    <Button onClick={() => alert("Hello")}>Click me</Button>
    <Button onClick={() => alert("World")}>Click me</Button>
  </div>
);
```

This is equivalent to:

```jsx
const ButtonGroup = () => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => alert("Hello")}>Click me</button>
    <button onClick={() => alert("World")}>Click me</button>
  </div>
);
```

We can _inline_ the `Button` component into the `ButtonGroup` component and remove the need for an extra
layer component layer for React to compute. This process can be done with more components, but when then
child component uses hooks, it can sometimes be difficult to inline them in parent components due to the
_"rules of hooks"_.

And it turns out that React Server Components don't allow such hooks.

### React Server Components

If you forget about async components and data fetching for a second, React Server Components is the idea of
"inlining" or "precomputing" certain components during SSR, and never needing to render those components at all.

But let's also consider async components. They are "run" initially on the server, and their result in _inlined_
into the actual React app. It's best to think of server components as not being React components at all, but
a way to _generate_ React components on the server. The old cliché should now be updated:

```jsx
Fn = ServerFn(ServerData);

UI = Fn(STATE);
```

import { Details } from "@/mdx-components";

<Details>
  <summary>Shorter Representation</summary>

You may have seen this same idea represented more succinctly as:

```jsx
UI = Fn(DATA)(STATE);
// or
UI = Fn(DATA, STATE);
```

I've chosen the longer representation because I think it makes the concept clearer.

</Details>

Server components are _higher-order functions_, that return the functions that constitue the client app components.
The concept is radically simple. It's really just a function. But functions are powerful, and this power can be
confusing. It is important to understand the patterns for _how_ these functions should be used and composed to
get the most out of them.

### React Server Component patterns

It is important to remember that React Server Components are _functions_. Don't think of them as client side components
that can contain state and effects. These functions are mostly _pure_, and return some data. That data just happens to
be JSX which is something that React knows how to render.

Let's now consider some of the design patterns for using functions that will translate over to React Server Components,
as well.

#### Composition

One server component can use another server component.
