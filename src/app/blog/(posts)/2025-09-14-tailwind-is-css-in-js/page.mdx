The exact way that we write CSS for our web apps is a niche topic, and yet there is a huge amount
of variety and discussion around it. Things have evolved a lot over the years. We started from a world
preprocessors like Sass and Less, to CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components and Emotion, to CSS
modules and finally to atomic CSS.

However, this journey has created some confusion and ill-defined terminology, and nothing is quite
as bad as the term "CSS-in-JS".

### What is CSS-in-JS?

The term "CSS-in-JS" came about with early libraries such as
[Radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium), [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite),
and [Glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor). These libraries and their more modern
counterparts like [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/),
all let you define your styles within your JavaScript (or TypeScript) files.

However, these libraries also _injected_ the styles using Javascript at runtime. Some of them
included ways to "server render" the styles, but none of them had a way to generate a static
CSS file.

This started to change with the advent of libraries like [Linaria](https://linaria.dev/), which
let you define you styles with mostly the same syntax as Emotion, but instead of injecting the styles
at runtime, it would generate a static CSS file.

So, the question arises, what is CSS-in-JS?

And the answer is that, as a community, we have never really defined it. In one definition,
it is anything that injects CSS at runtime. In another definition, it is anything that that gives
you the ability to write CSS in your JavaScript files.

And so, the question really becomes, do we care about how it works, or how it looks?

### It's how it works

If you're in the camp that would like to define CSS-in-JS, based on how it works, then of course,
Tailwind is _not_ CSS-in-JS. Neither is Linaria and nor is StyleX.

None of these libraries use runtime injection of CSS. Although all three work in different ways, they
all generate a static CSS file at build time. And when comparing Tailwind and StyleX, they result in
shockingly similar code with the mostly same performance characteristics.

And so, when you hear people say, "CSS-in-JS is dead", they aren't talking about Linaria, Tailwind
or StyleX. They're talking about the libraries that inject CSS at runtime.

### It's how it looks

If, however, you're in the camp of how it looks, then you would consider Linaria and StyleX to be
CSS-in-JS. In that case, however, I would argue that Tailwind is CSS-in-JS, too.

Just like other CSS-in-JS libraries, Tailwind lets you define your styles directly within your
JavaScript files. The syntax is different. Instead of using CSS syntax in template strings like Linaria,
or JavaScript objects like StyleX, Tailwind uses a special syntax made of special classNames, but
it is still very much a syntax where you're able to write arbitrary styles with arbitrary values.

Back in the days of Tailwind 1 and 2, you could make the argument that this wasn't the case, but ever since
the Tailwind JIT and support for syntax as such as `[]` for adding arbitrary values, Tailwind is
very much CSS-in-JS.

#### Tailwind is bad at being CSS-in-JS

While Tailwind is very much CSS-in-JS, as a syntax, it's not very good at being CSS-in-JS. While the
className abstraction is great for quickly prototyping styles, it falls apart outside of the common
use-cases. Writing CSS keyframes, view transitions, anchor positioning and anything out of the ordinary
means reaching for an actual CSS file.

This syntactic limit isn't particularly problematic for devX. It just forces you to think in two different
paradigms for different styles in your codebase.

However, it does create some friction when choosing how to generate the static CSS files for particularly
large applications.

### Conclusion

I don't really care about the definition of CSS-in-JS. The industry is rapidly moving away from anything
that injects CSS at runtime. The performance penalty is well known, and even those using libraries
like Emotion or Styled Components are starting to migrate to newer solutions that generate static CSS files.

However, if the only reason you've been scared of using Tailwind (or even Linaria) is because you've heard
all the bad things about CSS-in-JS, then you can rest easy. Either StyleX isn't CSS-in-JS, or Tailwind is.
