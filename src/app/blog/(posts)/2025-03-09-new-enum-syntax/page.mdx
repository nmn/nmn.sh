There has been a lot of excitement around Typescript lately. There's the Go rewrite to look forward to.
But even without the wait, Node.js has _finally_ added native support for Typescript syntax. An interesting
detail about this native support is that it can only _remove_ typescript syntax, it cannot _transform_ the
syntax itself. This is not new, as other projects have implemented Typescript compilers that work similarly
and replace the type annotations with whitespace, making line and column numbers _just work_ even after
transformation. This is to say nothing about the performance benefits of such a simple transformation.

The Typescript team itself has seen value in this and has shipped a new `--erasable-syntax-only` flag,
that disallows certain Typescript features that are not compatible with such a transformation. Fortunately,
none of these incompatible features are all that important to begin with and are usually just syntax conveniences
that helps write less code. There is one exception, however, `enums`.

### Syntax Proposal

Many, including myself, would argue that Typescript enums are a mess and it's better to just use union types instead.
However, `enums` are a useful feature and this is a great opportunity to get them right. Here's my proposal for
how it could work:

```typescript
const LogLevel = {
  info: "info",
  warning: "warning",
  error: "error",
} as enum;
```

Typescript already supports `as const` and `as SomeType` to annotate javascript expressions. This same syntax could
be extended to support simple object expressions as a way to define `enums`. This _new_ enum would be a plain object
only and would not have any of the other fancy runtime features that Typescript enums do today. `enum`s should purely
be a typesystem feature.

Of course, enums should support different kinds of backing values.

```typescript
const Level = {
  low: 0,
  medium: 1,
  high: 2,
} as enum;
```

Typescript could validate that all values within an enum are the same primitive type.

The usage with `switch` statements would work as expected:

```typescript
switch (level) {
  case Level.low:
    return "low";
  case Level.medium:
    return "medium";
  case Level.high:
    return "high";
}
```

### OptionSets

This is also an opportunity to introduce a _new_ feature to typescript: Option Sets. It is sometimes
useful to create a type where you can have _more_ than a single value at a time. This is usually done
by using bitshifting and bitwise OR, but there has been no typesystem support for this so far.

By enforcing certain patterns, this could be made possible in Typescript:

```typescript
const TextOptions = {
  autoCorrect: 1 << 0,
  autoCaptitalize: 1 << 1,
  autoComplete: 1 << 2,
} as optionSet;
```

Typescript would enforce that each of the individual options is expressed as a bitshift expression
with no overlaps.

Additional "convenience" value can be included as getter functions:

```typescript
const TextOptions = {
  autoCorrect: 1 << 0,
  autoCaptitalize: 1 << 1,
  autoComplete: 1 << 2,

  get everything(): TextOptions {
    return this.autoCorrect | this.autoCaptitalize | this.autoComplete;
  },
} as optionSet;
```

The slightly more interesting question would be how to _use_ these optionSets.
Typescript could treat optionSets distinctly from numbers and disallow arbitrary
mathematical expressions except those that are relevant, such as:

```typescript
if (TextOptions.autoCorrect & (textOptions !== 0)) {
  config.autoCorrect = true;
}
if (TextOptions.autoCaptitalize & (textOptions !== 0)) {
  config.autoCaptitalize = true;
}
if (TextOptions.autoComplete & (textOptions !== 0)) {
  config.autoComplete = true;
}
```

It would only be valud to `|` or `&` with another value of the same type
and comparison against `0`.

### Enums with Data?

Now, getting into the more holy grail situation of enums, it would great to support
enums with data. Again, this is already possible with union types, but could there be
a way to add first class support at the typesystem level that could help simplify things
and improve performance in large projects?

Expressing such a type seems possible.

```typescript
const Result = {
  error(message: string) {
    return { type: "error", message };
  },
  ok(data: T) {
    return { type: "ok", data };
  },
} as enum<T>;
```

However, when it comes to actually using such a type and enforcing exhaustiveness, things get
a bit more complicated. Ideally, we'd get [native support](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching)
for `match` expressions in Javascript and Typescript could lean on that.

```typescript
const result = Result.ok('hello');

const dataOrErrMsg = match (result) {
  when { type: 'ok', let data }: data;
  when { type: 'error', let message }: message;
}
```

However, while we wait for the `pattern-matching` proposal to gain traction, we could
add an additional constraint to enums with data and require all possible values to be
objects with a consistent `key`.

This would mean that something like this would be invalid:

```typescript
const Result = {
  yes(data: T) {
    return { type: "yes", data };
  },
  no() {
    // All cases of enums with data must return an object
    // with a `type` property
    return false;
  },
  error(message: string) {
    return { type: "error", message };
  },
} as enum<T>;
```

Ideally, the keyname should be configurable, and Typescript should be able to
infer that in this case the key is `type`, but you should be able to use any
consistent key that you want.

#### A compromise?

The enums with data proposal is definitely a lot more complex that simply introducing
a new simple syntax for enums. Perhaps we could compromise in the meantime and settle
on something simpler for enums with data in the meantime?

```typescript
const ResultKey = {
  error: "error",
  ok: "ok",
} as enum;
const Result = {
  error(message: string) {
    return { [ResultKey.error]: message };
  },
  ok(data: T) {
    return { [ResultKey.ok]: data };
  },
} satisfies EnumWithData<ResultKey, "type">;
```

Where Typescript ships a new utility type `EnumWithData<EnumKey, KeyName>` which would enforce
that all possible values of `EnumKey` are objects with a `KeyName` property.

```typescript
type EnumWithData<EnumKey, KeyName extends string> = {
  [K in EnumKey]: { [KeyName]: K };
};
```

## Conclusion

The new tools and implementations of Typescript that simply erase types is a great step forward.
It lets us move in a direction that would be compatible with the _types as comments_ proposal.

But we should settle for losing out on useful features as we move into this new world. We should
come up with new syntax solutions that help us bring along useful typesystem features without adding
new syntax. And while we're at it, we should also fix the major mistakes in Tyepscript such as how
enums behave today!
