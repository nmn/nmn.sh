The recent iPhone 16E launch has me thinking about Apple's pricing strategy. They've
raised the entry-level iPhone from $430 to $600, which is a significant jump. While
most discussions center around features like the omission of MagSafe or Ultra Wideband.
I see a more interesting shift happening: Apple seems to be deliberately
moving away from the budget smartphone segment altogether.

### “Budget” Apple?

Apple likes to make premium products and proudly say that they won't make "junk".
But they _have_ made budget products before and continue to do so in certain product categories.

#### iPods

During the iPod's peak, Apple maintained a presence across all price segments. From the premium
iPod Classic to the affordable iPod Shuffle, they offered options at $100, $200, and $400 price
points, effectively dominating the personal music player market.

#### iPads

With iPads, Apple maintains this inclusive approach. The iPad Pro sits at the premium end around
$1,000, but you can still get an entry-level iPad for about $330. They clearly see value in
maintaining a presence in the budget tablet market.

#### Macs

Although historically Apple has strayed away from ever making budget Macs, that seems to be changing,
too.

- The Mac Mini starts at $600 and is widely acclaimed not just for being a great product, but a great value.
- The M4 MacBook Air just got a price drop starts at $999 with 16GB of RAM in the base configuration.
- Apple still sells the M1 Macbook Air through Walmart for as low as $699.

### So what about a budget iPhone?

While Apple never made a truly budget iPhone, they did make three generations of iPhone SE,
which was a "budget iPhone" by Apple standards. But they seem to be abandoning that market with
the iPhone 16E.

There are a few ways I can interpret this:

Firstly, it's possible that the SE simply wasn't profitable enough for Apple and they're simply trying
a new strategy. Apple has changed stragies before when they abandoned the _mini_ iPhones, and rumours
suggest that the _plus_ will be discontinued soon, too.

Another possibility is that this new situation is a temporary result of Apple moving to USB-C, and that
the iPhone 16E will drop by $100 a year later and be sold at $500, while an iPhone 17E will replace it
at the current $600.

But I can't shake this feeling that perhaps Apple is intentionally getting out of the budget smartphone
market to avoid gaining too much market share.

It's well known that Apple has a [dominant profit share](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-again-dominates-smartphone-profit-031537788.html)
in the smartphone market. However, most antitrust and anti-monopoly regulations are generally focused on
market share, not profit share. Perhaps, Apple is trying to thread the needle of trying to make
as much money as possible without gaining a monopoly in terms of market share.

### Risks ahead

_If_ I'm right about this, Apple might be taking a big risk. The smartphone market has strong
network effects and intentionally giving up market share might become a self-fulfilling prophecy
in the long run.

But it's also possible that I'm completely wrong about this and Apple is just optimizing for
both money _and_ market share and we will only understand their actual strategy in hindsight.
