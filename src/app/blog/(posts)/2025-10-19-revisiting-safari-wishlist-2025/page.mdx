Half a year ago, I wrote [an article](/blog/2025-01-07-safari-wishlist-2025) about why I use Safari as my
default (non-development) browser. In it, I described what I like about StyleX, what I dislike and a list
of my wishlist for Safari in 2025. With the Safari 19 announcement at WWDC, let's look at what I got and
what I didn't.

## Web standards

### SVG favicons

FINALLY!! This is huge simply because it was glaring gap in Safari. Welcome to the 2010s Safari!

### Scroll Driven Animations

As expected Safari 19 will have full support for the new Scroll-linked animations in CSS. This feature has been
available for a while now, but it was behind a flag. It will finally be enabled by default in Safari 19.

This is perhaps the most exciting feature for the web platform since view transitions and container queries before
that. The ability to have declarative scroll-linked animations that is easy but also performant will help us
deliver a huge jump in the quality of interaction design on the web. All previous solutions to achieve the same
results depended on using scroll event in Javascript, which worked but had the tendency to lag and drop frames.

This, combined with existing CSS features such as Scroll Snap also open the door to building fluid swipe interactions
on the web. I'm very excited about this even if Firefox support is still unknown at this point.

### Anchor Positioning

I'll be honest, I was not very optimistic about this feature in 2025. However, the Webkit team has delivered and
Anchor Positioning is coming to Safari 19! This feature isn't quite as consequential as Scroll Linked animations
as it was possible with a lot of custom, tricky code to achieve this in the past, but Anchor Positioning will
be a huge improvement to developer experience when building menus, tooltips, hovercards etc. All while reducing
the chances of subtle annoying bugs in the implementation.

### `interpolate-size`

I do not know the status of this feature in Safari 19 yet.

## Other asks

I have yet to install the macOS 26 beta so will update this section in the future.
