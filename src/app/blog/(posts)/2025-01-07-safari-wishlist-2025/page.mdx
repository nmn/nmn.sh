For the last few years [Jen Simmons](https://bsky.app/profile/jensimmons.bsky.social) has been working for Safari.
The last few years has also seen massive improvements in the development of Safari. This _may_ be a coincidence. Credit
probably goes to other people, such as [Nicole Sullivan](https://bsky.app/profile/nicolesullivan.bsky.social),
as well. However, Jen Simmons has become the face of Safari in public and seems to be a driving force
behind a lot of the improvements.

Recently, I saw a question from her asking for our biggest wishes for Safari in 2025.
Since I have a lot to say, I decided to write a blog post about it.

import { Post } from "@/app/components/bsky";

<Post handle="jensimmons.bsky.social" id="3lf3t5mjhbc23" />

Now, whenever we talk about browsers and wishlists, as developers, we tend to focus on
web standards and missing features in Webkit itself. However, I think it is valuable to
take a step back and think about what Safari is missing from a user's perspective.

## Why I use Safari as my primary browser

I have been using Safari as my primary browser for years now. I have always had to use Chrome
(or another Chromium-based browser) for certain use-cases, but in the last few years there another
fewer and fewer reasons to need Chrome.

On the flip side, there are few feature in Safari that make it difficult for me to switch away and
why I could never fully switch to Arc or Brave.

### Reader Mode

Safari's Reader Mode is one of the best features of Safari. It is a simple way to remove the clutter
from a website and focus on the content. Further, it is possible to configure settings on a per-site
basis so that certain websites default to Reader view. I have long been using this feature to avoid
dealing with the overbearing ads and designs of certain (mostly news) websites.

### Some amazing Safari-only extensions

There are a lot of legitimate criticisms of how Safari handles extensions. You're forced to package
extensions are apps, deal with Apple's notarization or worse, app review. However, this has also enabled
the existence of extensions that can charge money in return for a more _premium_ experience. I have a few
such apps/extensions that keep me coming back to Safari:

- [Vinegar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vinegar-tube-cleaner/id1591303229) - An extension that replaces the Youtube player with a fairly vanilla
  HTML5 `<video>` player, blocks ads and generally provides a much nicer experience. I have tried to find
  similar extensions for Chrome or Firefox but have yet to find anything that even comes close.
- [Noir](https://getnoir.app) - is a browser extension that adds a dark mode to any website. There are of course
  many extensions that do this across all browsers, but nothing is even close to as good as Noir. Compared to other
  similar extensions, Noir is much better at detecting existing dark modes, keeping content readable and generally
  creating a much better color scheme when generating a new dark mode. Other extensions _look_ like a hack. Noir is
  so good, I usually even forget that I'm using an extension. The results look _that_ good.
- [1Blocker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1blocker-ad-blocker-for-safari/id1460572424) - is an ad blocker, but it's
  the _nicest_ ad blocker I have ever used. It does a great job at blocking ads while not affecting performance (more
  on this below) and has some really nice features to manually hide elements on a per-site basis. I paid for it back when
  it was a one-time purchase. Unfortunately, it has since moved to a subscription model, so I'm not sure I can continue to
  recommend it.

### The best content blocking

Safari was the first browser to ship a declarative content blocking system. (And despite the fact that it shipped years ago,
it was more powerful than what Chrome is trying to ship in manifest v3.) This system, along with an extension like 1Blocker,
is great at blocking ads and other annoying elements on a website and usually _improving_ performance. It's also great to
have the peace of mind that the ad blocker can't be used to track you.

### Scrolling performance

This is a subtle thing, but Safari has the smoothing scrolling performance of all browser engines. This has sometimes come at the
cost of features, but I can _feel_ how smooth the scrolling is

### The UI

This is obviously a lot more subjective, but I generally like how Safari looks, and I prefer many of the small UI details:

- I like that as the number of tabs increases, they become scrollable rather super tiny like they do in Chrome.
- I like how easy it is customize the toolbar
- I like the sidebar and how Tab Groups work
- I like how the browser chrome is more compact

And I know I'm in the minority here, but I've never liked the tabs on top design that Chrome pioneered. There was period of time
(15 yeaes ago!) when Safari copied that design and I didn't like Safari's implementation either.

import tabsOnTop from "./safari-toptabs.jpg";

<Image
  width={586}
  height={68}
  alt="Safari's tabs on top design"
  src={tabsOnTop}
/>

### <strike>Battery Life</strike>

This used to be the case, but Chrome has since caught up and Safari doesn't have a battery life advantage anymore.

## How is _this_ still missing?

### Custom Search Engines

import searchEngines from "./search-engines.png";

<Image
  width={522}
  height={278}
  alt="Safari's search engines"
  src={searchEngines}
/>

There are many issues that Safari has outside of Webkit itself, but none are more infuriating than
the fact that Safari still doesn't support the ability to define your own custom search engines.

I have been using browser extensions such as [xSearch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1579902068)
to define custom search engines for years now and while it is functional it is _far_ from being a seamless experience.
Sorry to be cynical, but I think Apple is taking money from search engines to be included in the list of available
search engines.

### SVG Favicons

The lack of support for SVG favicons is an embarrassment. Safari previously _required_ SVG icons for "Pinned Tabs",
so it's all the more baffling that Safari still doesn't support SVG favicons.

SVG Favicons solve two major problems:

- Vector icons can be resolution-independent and look great on high-DPI displays.
- SVG can use media queries within to provide different icons for light and dark mode.

### Tabs on the side

Safari has supported a sidebar for many years and it is more powerful than it may seem. It shows Tab Groups and
the tabs within them. The Tab Groups can be collapsed and expanded. You can even drag to reorder tabs.

However, there are two major missing features that makes using it as a workflow infeasible:

- [ ] There is no fast way to close tabs from the sidebar (although there _is_ a context menu). There _needs_ to be a simple `X` button.
- [ ] There is no way to hide the tabs at the top of Safari.

### Dev Tools extensions

Dev tools extensions, such as [React Dev Tools](https://react.dev/reference/devtools) do not work in Safari.
Safari itself seemingly supports dev tools extensions now, but I have yet to see one actually exist. This
needs to be prioritized.

## How is this still _so_ broken?

There are couple of things that have long been broken in Safari and I'm not sure why they haven't been fixed.

- Reading List syncing across devices is badly broken and completely unreliable.
- Tab Group syncing is similarly broken and unreliable.
  - Shared Tab Groups is a great feature but it's not something I can rely on if the sync is this broken.
- There is general bugginess when trying to enable extensions within specific profiles.

## The next top web standards

Safari has added a bunch of amazing features in 2024 or is already in the process of adding them. This includes
my _personal_ most important features:

- [x] View Transitions API
- [x] `text-box-trim`
- [x] WASM GC
- [/] Scroll Driven Animations

There are also a couple of amazing features that are seemingly _only_ in Safari at the moment:

- [x] `text-box-trim`
- [x] Scalar division in `calc()`

So now, it's the time to ask for the next set of features that I'm personally most excited about.

### Anchor Positioning

Anchor positioning is an amazing feature that will simplify _so many_ layout concerns that currently rely
on JavaScript. There are obvious use-cases for positioning various popovers, but it actually goes a lot further
and can be used for esoteric use-cases like positioning a custom focus ring that isn't clipped by a parent's
`overflow: hidden`.

### Actually ship Scroll Driven Animations

I think will happen soon, but I just want to reiterate how awesome this feature is.

### `interpolate-size`

Let us finally animate to `height: auto`. This is an obvious win.

## Bug fixes and performance improvements

Safari is keeping up when it comes to new features these days. View Transitions shipped months after Chrome.
`:has()` and `text-box-trim` shipped months _before_ Chrome.

However, Safari _still_ has the lowest web platform test score of the three major browser engines. I don't put
too much stock in these scores. Firstly, the "tests that fail in exactly one browser" is a misleading metric to
begin with, the overall percentage compliance is a much better metric. Secondly, not all features are equally
important.

However, it _is_ important to have good, stable implementations of the most important features. And among these,
my biggest wish is for better SVG support.

## Webkit is right about `masonry`

Also in 2025, I would love to see Safari and Webkit win the debate that masonry layout belong in Grid Layout.
Ahmad Shadeed already wrote [a great article](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-masonry/) making the case
for why masonry layout belongs in Grid Layout, so I won't rehash that here.

## Conclusion

There were some dark years for Safari where it lagged years behind the other browsers. Things have turned around
massively. Here's hoping that 2025 will bring more of the same and we will be able to retire the "Safari is the new IE"
meme for good.
