The Tailwind CSS v4.0 beta was [just released](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta),
and I wanted to share some thoughts on it. More specifically, I have some concerns
that I have not seen covered elsewhere.

Rather than provide any high level insight, let me address the various changes in
Tailwind 4 individually.

**DISCLAIMER**: These words are my own and do not represent the views of my employer.

### The move to LightningCSS

Moving to LightningCSS is a good move. The JS community is largely moving to rust-based
tooling and being on LightningCSS will help keep Tailwind easy to integrate with various
tools. The performance improvements are substantial, but not particularly important. Tailwind
JIT was already fast enough.

The biggest benefit of LightningCSS is the **unification** of Tailwind, imports and syntax lowerings.
Not having to manually configure `Autoprefixr` is a big win.

### CSS-first configuration

There is much excitement about the CSS-first configuration. I don't think this as much of a
slam dunk as many others. It has trade-offs. The big benefit is the need for one fewer boilerplate
file for getting started.

The downside is that most of the configuation is custom syntax specific to Tailwind and it's no
longer type-safe. Hopefully tooling will help bridge this gap.

In the meantime, Tailwind continues to support the old JS configuration by allowing you to import
it in your CSS file.

```css
@config "../../tailwind.config.js";
```

Despite the trade-offs, I think this will end up proving to be a good move in the long run.

### CSS theme variables

This is where the concerns start. Architecturally, using _real_ CSS variables is an obvious win.
However, in practice, using CSS variables can have some surprising performance pitfalls. The
performance issues are inconsistent and when using a bunch of variables defined on `:root`, the
impact seems to be minimal. However, re-assigining variables or definining variables on another
element _in addition_ to `:root` can have a significant performance impact.

So, as long most devs don't go overboard with custom scoped overrides for variables, things should
be OK. It is also possible to configure to Tailwind to inline the variables in the CSS output, just
like Tailwind 3 and earlier:

```css
@theme inline {
  /* ... */
  --color-black: #000;
  --color-white: #fff;
  /* ... */
}
```

Most developers configure their themes _globally_ and scoped overrides for the variables
is not a common use-case. So, I wonder if inlining variables would have been a better default.

### Native CSS cascade layers

This is an unmitigated sucess and an obvious win. My biggest surprise was to learn that this wasn't
already the case. There are certain older browsers that don't support cascade layers, but it's a
simple polyfill to fix that.

### Simplified theme configuration

A bunch of values that were previously configurable now just allow arbitrary values, such as `grid-cols-73`,
without the need for `[73]`. This is a good move and removes unnecessary boilerplate and friction.

### Some other obvious wins

There's a few too many to mention individually, so here's some of the other obvious improvements:

- Automatic source detection
- Built-in `@import` support
- Built-in CSS transpilation
- Dynamic spacing scale
- P3 colors.
- Container Query support
- 3D transforms (_finally_)

And many others... If you want to read every new thing in Tailwind 4, they have some
[great documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta). I'll limit my opinions to what I find
_controversial_.

### Gradients

Tailwind 4 finally adds support for radial and conic gradients. While this is an obvious improvment,
I think Tailwind has never handled gradients well. Defining gradients inline is problematic and the
usage of CSS variables to do is problematic. Using `"from-indigo-500 via-blue-400 to-teal-300"` is
not something that belongs on the HTML directly.

Tailwind should ship with a set of predefined beautiful gradients that can be used out of the box and
let developers define their own gradients in the config file.

Still, this is not a new issue it has always been possible to not use these utilities and define
gradients in the configuation file.

### New `not-*` and `in-*` "variants"

Tailwind has added support for `:not()` and `:hover *` with the new `not-*` and `in-*` variants.

```html
<button class="bg-indigo-600 hover:not-focus:bg-indigo-700">
  <!-- ... -->
</button>

<div class="opacity-50 in-focus:opacity-100">
  <!-- fill be opacity:1; when *within* a focused element -->
</div>
```

These are good improvements and good way to maintain the guarantees of atomic styles.

### The `inert-*` and `nth-*` variants

These variants are _slightly_ problematic. They let you use `[inert]` and `:nth-child()` selectors
in your classNames. This encourages the same bad practices that atomic CSS in general and Tailwind
in particular has always discouraged.

At least these variants do not encourage "styling at a distance", and so while they may result
in CSS bloat, they will not be particularly harmful.

### Descendant variants

There are many celebrating this destruction of atomic CSS guarantees, but I think this is probably
the most **harmful** addition to Tailwind. _Ever_.

The `*` variant for tagetting direct children was already added and was problematic enough:

```html
<ul class="*:p-4">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

This actively encourages "styling at a distance", but at least it was contained and limited to
direct children. The new `**` variant ruins this completely:

```html
<div class="**:data-avatar:rounded-full">
  <div>
    <img src="…" data-avatar />
    <!-- This element will be round -->
  </div>
  <p>…</p>
</div>
```

Others see power, I see chaos. Tailwind has finally jumped the shark and has added essentially all of
CSS into classNames. This is no longer atomic CSS, and developers will abuse the hell out of this
and run into all of the terrible problems that Tailwind saved them from in the first place.

There is still time, this **"feature"** should be rolled back before it's too late!

## Other longstanding issues

While I'm talking about Tailwind, let me also raise some longstanding concerns that I've had.

### The classNames could be better

Tailwind _usually_ has a "prefix" in the className to suggest the style being applied:

- `bg-red-500` for `background-color`
- `m-sm` for `margin`
- `pt-4` for `padding-top`
- etc.

However, there are some classNames where the _style_ being applied isn't as obvious:

- `flex` applies `display: flex;`
- `grid` applies `display: grid;`
- `text-` can apply `color` _or_ `font-size`

In recent versions, this has become even more common with `grow` and `shrink` replacing
`flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` respectively.

While these changes are good for brevity, they can sometimes increase confusion and can
have a significant impact on the code size and runtime cost of tools such as `tailwind-merge`.

The Tailwind team tends to discourage the use `tailwind-merge` and expect all styles to be
applied statically. However, IMO, this an unrealistic expectation almost every serious project
that uses Tailwind ususally also uses `tailwind-merge`.

I think Tailwind should make it easier for tools such as `tailwind-merge` to exist and be as
performant as possible. As a side-effect, it might also make the styles easier and more consistent
to read and work with.

### The rampant usage of `rem` units

It is easy to change the default theme but the default theme for Tailwind uses `rem` units for
absolutely everything. From `font-size` to spacing, and from sizing to media queries. Designers
_love_ this as this lets them maintain their previous proportions, but this actually an accessibility
anti-pattern.

When browsing a website, a user is able to control sizing in two ways:

- Use page zoom
- Change the default font size

Using `rem` for spacing and sizing removes the ability of the user to change the default font size
and makes it work like a second way to zoom instead. This is user-hostile and forces users you perhaps
need slightly larger text to be able to read confortable to be forced into a layout made for smaller
screens with less density.

The solution to this problem is simple. The default values for spacing, sizing and media queries should
all use `px` units and `rem` should be used exclusively for `font-size`.

## Conclusion

While this post happened to focus on the negatives, that is only because the postives are so obvious
there isn't much to say. I'm very much nitpicking here, but given the massive popularity of Tailwind,
I think it's important to provide constructive criticism and help improve the tool for the entire
community.

On my end, [`tw-to-stylex`](https://github.com/nmn/tw-to-stylex) has already been upgraded to use
Tailwind 4 behind the scenes and I'm excited to take it even further and more feature rich.
