If you've even dipped your toe into the world of web development discource online,
you've probably seen the endless debates, arguments and flame wars about which is
the "best" framework. The React camp might argue about it's adoption and featureset.
The Solid.js camp may argue about it's performance and point to certain benchmarks.
The Svelte camp might argue about it's simplicity and point to that one-liner meme.

Turns out, there is no best framework. But this isn't just a cop out where I say "it depends",
and say that every framework has it's use-cases. I mean, that's true, but that's not the point
I'm trying to make. What's important to understand isn't just what each framework _is_ good at,
but to understand what problems each framework is even _trying_ to solve.

Let's take React as an example. React doesn't often win performance benchmarks and
that is often used as an attack against it. However, React isn't _trying_ to be the fastest
at synthetic benchmarks. If you pay attention to what the React team has been saying,
you'd start to see some of the core priorities of React:

- The data being rendered by React should not need to be wrapped in a special data structure.
- It should be easy to reason about the UI as a function of data and state
- It should be easy to keep UI responsive as it scales in complexity

Now consider what Ryan Carniato seems to prioritize when working on Solid.js:

- Make use of fine-grained reactivity and minime the work needed for updates
- Maximize performance for common use-cases
- Strive for architectural simplicity and minimalism

One way I like to think about this is that Solid is like a really fast and well optimized
single-threaded program, while React is like a massively multi-threaded program. In many
cases the extra threads might add unnecceary overhead, but in some cases, it might be
exactly what you need. Solid might be faster in most cases, but that performance means
that features such as concurrent rendering aren't prioritized as highly.

These are two extremely different approaches to building UIs. One of them may be better
suited to a particular project, but more importantly, one of them might align more closely
with how _you_ think.
